# SQL-Murder-Investigation
### üß† Project: Solving the Murder of Roland Greene  
**Date:** June 1, 2025  
**Tools:** SQL Server  
**Focus:** Forensics, movement tracking, call pattern analysis  
**Datasets Used:**  
- `suspects.csv`  
- `access_logs.csv`  
- `call_records.csv`  
- `forensics_events.csv`

## üìå Overview

This project investigates the murder of **Roland Greene**, a wealthy art collector, using structured SQL queries across four relational datasets. The goal was to **identify the killer(s)** by analyzing access logs, validating alibis, and correlating calls and forensic events.

## üóÉÔ∏è Data Schema

| name                | Full name                          |
| role                | Social/professional role           |
| relation_to_victim  | Relationship with the victim       |
| alibi               | Claimed whereabouts                |

**2. `access_logs`**  
| Column Name     | Description                            |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
| suspect_id      | ID referencing suspects                |
| access_time     | Timestamp of door access               |
| door_accessed   | Door location accessed                 |
| success_flag    | 1 if access was granted, 0 if denied   |

**3. `call_records`**  
| Column Name         | Description                          |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| suspect_id          | ID referencing suspects              |
| call_time           | Timestamp of the call                |
| call_duration       | Duration of the call in seconds      |
| recipient_relation  | Recipient's relation to the caller   |


## üìÖ Timeline of Key Events

| Time       | Event Description                               |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 7:55 PM    | Last phone call to victim                       |
| 7:57 PM    | Victim seen alive (last time)                   |
| 8:00 PM    | Gunshot heard                                   |
| 8:01 PM    | Movement detected in vault hallway              |
| 8:03 PM    | Security feed cut                               |

## Murder Theory
Primary Culprit: Victor Shaw (rival, confirmed presence at crime scene)

Killer: Robin Ahmed (last seen with victim, medical background)

Accomplices:

‚Ä¢	Jamie Bennett (diversion, misdirection after gunshot)

‚Ä¢	Susan Knight (cut security feed at exact time)



These suspects acted in coordination based on the timeline and data overlaps.
